# Water Level Detector for Arduino, Nano or...
### just about any microcontroller
A simple device that can detect the water level - no moving parts and totally sealed.

An ideal beginners' project to detect when liquid has reached a certain level. This module can be mounted at just about any angle,as I show in the video.  

The best aspects of this device is that it is **totally sealed** and has no moving parts. The output is best detected by an analog GPIO pin but the value jumps very suddenly from the high 900s to pretty much zero.

The device fits through a hole in a water tank, water butt, pond... or anthing else that contains water or other liquid. It could even be fitted to a bracket and totally immersed. It can detect the liquid at various angles, top down, bottom up, sideways; it's really very simple.

The video contains much more detail and also discusses progreas on a couple of other PCB-based projects.
