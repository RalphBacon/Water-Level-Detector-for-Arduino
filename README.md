# Water-Level-Detector-for-Arduino
A simple device that can detect water - no moving parts and totally sealed

An ideal beginners' project to detect when liquid has reached a certain level. This module can be mounted at just about any angle,as I show in the video.

The best aspects of this device is that it is **totally sealed** and has no moving parts. The output is best detected by an analog GPIO pin but the value jumps very suddenly from the high 900s to pretty much zero.
